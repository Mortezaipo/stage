When you start working on source code of a project which you are not familiar with,
it would be hard to understand it and it's concepts and aspects.
<!-- more -->
So in this situation several ways could help you to become fit with the project's structure:

* **Build And Run The Program**: this way helps you to find external libraries, compiler, linker options. Also you can read logs to understand it better.
* **Find High-Level Logic**: find out how it initials and terminates itself.
* **Draw Some Flowcharts**: it's hard to keep all the information in your head, so try to draw some flowcharts or state diagrams while reading.
* **Examine Library Calls**: if the program uses external libraries, try to examine them and read documents about them.
* **Search For The Keywords**: try to search keywords which you wish to know about them in source code.
* **Leverage The Power Of Code Comprehension Tools**: uses some tools to read source code and generate diagram which can help you to find answers of your questions.
* **Print The Code**: by this way you can highlight some parts of source code and easily write your comments in paper. (Note: before getting any print, kindly think about the nature.)
* **Write UnitTests**: it will help you to write some codes which increase your knowledge about how source code suppose to be.
* **Add Comments In The Source Code**: comments in source codes could help you and others to understand the code behavior.
* **Clean Up The Code**: try it rewrite some parts of source code with different ways.
* **Read Some Other Projects Source Codes**: it will help you to understand some other ways of implementation.

Also try to read books to improve your knowledge, career and profession.
